    description: `Hi there! I'm Ryan.
    I'm a software developer, located in Portland, Oregon.
    
    I will be graduating from Alchemy Code Lab in June â€˜22. I like writing code that is clever and organized, semantic and accessible.
    
    In my free time I like riding bikes and roller skating, taking photos on film, spending time with my husband and dogs, and going out for coffee & brunch.
    
    Cache App has been a really cool project to work on with my team. I really just like writing code, and even better, writing code that gets users outside! While the idea was inspired by geocaching, I think the goal for us was just to allow users to share any of the interesting items they have found or placed out in the wild... from street art to natural wonders, painted rocks, or even just their favorite food trucks.
    
    Have some fun with this app and find me out in the wild:
